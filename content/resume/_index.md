# Owais Lone

I've been working in the tech industry professionally for almost ten years and have worn multiple hats while doing so. I've helped co-found startups, served as a CTO, brought together and grown awesome engineering teams, architected advanced software systems to solve complex problems, programmed solutions end to end (full-stack) and contributed (and maintained) to a number open-source software projects. I like designing and building advanced (but not complex) systems to solve hard problems, and building/growing great engineering teams.

## Technical Experience

I see myself as a generalist and like ot use the right tool for the right job and come up to speed with unfamiliar tech quite fast. That said, below are some of the technologies I've most professional experience with.

Python, Django, Go, Javascript/Typescript, Node, React(native), Flutter/Dart, Relational databases, (Postgresql, etc), Document stores (DynamoDB, Firebase, Redis, etc), Serverless/Lambda stuff, Containers/Docker, AWS, Google Cloud/Firebase, Gtk, etc.

<br/>
<br/>
## Open Source

<hr/>

I'm an active member of the Ubuntu and Django open source communities. I've contributed to different parts of Ubuntu mostly quickly and python-distutils-extra.

Apart from that, I've authored the following open source applications:


* Django Webpack Loader     &nbsp;[{{< anchor href="http://github.com/owais/django-webpack-loader">}}]
* Webpack Bundle Tracker    [{{<anchor href="http://github.com/owais/webpack-bundle-tracker">}}]
* Fogger                     &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[{{<anchor href="http://launchpad.net/fogger">}}]
* GmailWatcher              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[{{<anchor href="http://launchpad.net/gmailwatcher">}}]
* Django Userswitch         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[{{<anchor href="https://github.com/owais/django-userswitch">}}]
* Remember the rhythm       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[{{<anchor href="https://github.com/owais/remember-the-rhythm">}}]


Django webpack loader helps integrate Javascript build systems with Django and is one of most most if the the most popular Django libraries out there. Fogger was built in just a week and won silver in the very first Ubuntu App Showdown contest.
