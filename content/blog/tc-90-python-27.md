This Saturday I'll be delivering a workshop on the Python programming language in my college. Our university has an age old course for Computer Engineering. C is the introductory language and is taught using the Turbo C compiler from the 90s, VB 6 is considered the best way to make GIUs. It's time to introduce my friends to 2010 in Computer Science.

If this goes well, Django or PyGTK will be next.
