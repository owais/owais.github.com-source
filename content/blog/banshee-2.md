Just noticed a small but **nice** change in Banshee 2\. Usually, our music players minimize to system tray when closing the main window so that the music keeps playing in the background. We have to manually look for a quit function in order to entirely close the app or pause the music and let the app live in memory and consume cpu cycles. Banshee 2.0 has no quit function _per se_. Closing banshee while the music is playing <span class="meta" meta_description="minimizes to systray or soundmenu on Ubuntu" meta_name=" ">hides</span> the window, otherwise quits entirely. 

We need to promote this bahavior across the freedesktop scene. Abstract underlying concepts as much as we can and make apps inteligent enough to decide for themselves.
